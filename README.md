# WordPress Starter Theme

WP Starter Theme is a foundational starter theme for building out WordPress themes, websites, and projects. 

  - A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
  - A helpful 404 template.
  - A sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found in the comments of inc/custom-header.php to your header.php template.
  - Custom template tags in inc/template-tags that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
  - Some small tweaks in /inc/extras.php that can improve your theming experience. They can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php.
  - Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in js/keyboard-image-navigation.js and is enqueued from the image attachment template, image.php.
  - A script at js/navigation.js that makes your menu a toggled dropdown for small screens (like your phone) ready for CSS artistry. Itâ€™s enqueued in functions.php.
  - 5 sample CSS layouts in /layouts: Two sidebars on the left, two sidebars on the right, a sidebar on either side of your content, and two-column layouts with sidebars on either side.
  - Smartly organized starter CSS in style.css that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
  - The GPL license in license.txt. ðŸ™‚ Use it to make something cool.
